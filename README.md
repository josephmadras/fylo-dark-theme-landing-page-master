## My process

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- CSS Modules
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've reviewed the basis of Next JS. But I think using the framework for this design was simply an overkill.
Have I done bare HTML and CSS, I'd finished this challenge in a few hours. I've also learned positions and how to manipulate background-image.
